# Design patterns for production grade Go services

[![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/pippolo84/golab2020-ws-setup-test)

Use this repository to verify your Go and Docker configuration to execute the examples in the GoLab 2020 workshop **Design patterns for production grade Go services**

## Workshop prerequisites

### Previous Experience

As an intermediate workshop, familiarity with the basics of the Go programming language is expected. As a reference, you have already completed (or should be able to complete) [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/).

A previous experience in writing Go services may be useful, but not required.

### Setup

To install Go 1.15 and configure your environment properly, follow the instructions [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).

To test your local dev environment, run:

`go run main.go`

During the workshop, we will try the example code with some HTTP requests. `curl` is perfectly fine, but it may be easier to use a tool like [Insomnia Core](https://insomnia.rest/download/core/?) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

### [Optional] Gitpod

If you don't want to setup your local dev environment, you may want to try one in the cloud.

This repository, as the ones we will use for the workshop, will be available for use through [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/). Just click on the badge at the beginning of this README, login to the service and try:

`go run main.go`
